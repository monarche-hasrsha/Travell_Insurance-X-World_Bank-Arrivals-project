This project integrates **Travel Insurance transactional data** with **World Bank International Tourism Arrivals data** to provide market-normalized insights into travel insurance sales, claims, demographics, and destinations. The combination of internal sales data with global tourism arrivals helps evaluate performance relative to market size, not just raw volumes.

## 📊 Project Overview  
- **Dataset**:  
  - Travel Insurance dataset (policies, destinations, products, demographics, claims).  
  - World Bank International Tourism Arrivals dataset (country-level demand).  
- **Objective**: To identify key markets, top products, customer behavior, and risk areas.  
- **Tool**: Tableau for data visualization and interactive dashboards.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Sales Concentration**: A few destinations dominate sales, led by **Singapore**, followed by the US, Australia, China, Thailand, and Malaysia.  
- **Top Products**: Most revenue comes from **Annual Silver Plans** (esp. in Singapore) and **Cancellation Plans** across markets.  
- **Low Claims**: Claims are rare (~1.5%), but vary by product and destination.  
- **Customer Demographics**: Demographic breakdown by gender and age reveals buying patterns, though some missing data exists.  
- **Market Penetration**: Policies per 1M arrivals highlight under-served but high-demand regions like the US, China, Japan, and the UK.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations  
- **Double down in strongholds** like Singapore with loyalty pricing, bundles, and upsell strategies.  
- **Expand in high-travel, low-penetration markets** (US, China, Japan, UK) via airline/OTA partnerships and targeted offers.  
- **Product Mix**: Promote Cancellation in volatile markets, Annual Plans in business hubs, and Rental Vehicle coverage in car-heavy regions.  
- **Risk Management**: Monitor high-claim destinations, tighten underwriting, and enhance fraud/quality checks.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Tableau** – Dashboarding, interactivity, and visualization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Customer demographics, product mix, claim analysis.  
- **Enrichment with World Bank Data** – Benchmarking policies against real travel arrivals.
